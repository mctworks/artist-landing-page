      <h1>Commission Terms & Rules!</h1>
      <p>Immediate payment is required upfront after discussion of desired descriptions. I send the first sketch within a few days after receipt of payment. I allow up to three minor revisions; anything major will be an additional charge or cancelled entirely
        as I see fit.</p>

      <p>The turnaround time is between 1-3 days to about a few weeks depending on my work schedule. I draw on a part-time, often rare basis.</p>

      <p>I allow up to 3 free revisions. If the client is not satisfied after the 3, the commission is cancelled and the customer will be refunded promptly.</p>

      <p>I will draw: Fanart, original characters, anything cute and not overly complicated.</p>

      <p>I will NOT DRAW: anything weird or NSFW, fetishes, mechas, animals/furry stuff, anything I feel will be overly complicated.</p>

      <p>Refunds are as follows: I will refund if I fail to complete a commission at a reasonable time or complete deadlines, I feel that a client is harassing or too pushy with checking the status of a commission. I don't draw every single day of the week,
        I am not a personal drawing machine. Inspiration comes and goes, and life happens, but I will communicate as best as I can.</p>

      <p>Commissions are physical pieces of art; I do not do any digital art. They are drawn on Bristol paper with a protective backing and plastic wrap. All pieces are shipped with Priority Shipping. A tracking number will be provided. The postal system
        has its issues but about 90% of the time you will get your piece. If for some reason it gets lost, I will do my best to accomodate!</p>

      <p>I can deliver if a client is in the New Haven Area!</p>
